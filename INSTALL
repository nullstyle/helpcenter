INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  1. Install PHP.

     Instructions at http://www.php.net/docs.php

  2. Install MySQL.

     See http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html.

  3. Install PHP library dependencies.

     a) pecl_http

	Using pecl, the PHP Extension Community Library, install the
        pecl_http package:

          % sudo pecl install pecl_http
          Starting to download pecl_http-1.6.0.tar (Unknown size)
          ........

        You will be asked several questions; answer as you see fit.

        Add the following line to your php.ini file to enable the
        package (there should be a php.ini section labelled "DYNAMIC
        EXTENSIONS"; but it doesn't matter where this line goes):

          extension=http.so

        You can test the installation by running php on the command line:

          % echo '<?new HttpRequest();?>' | php

        If this doesn't give you an error, pecl_http has been
        installed successfully.

        Sprinkles has been tested with pecl_http version 1.6.0.

     b) HTTP_Request

        The HTTP_Request library can be installed at the command line
        using pear:

          % sudo pear install Http_Request

        Sprinkles has been tested with HTTP_Request version 1.4.2.

  4. Install Sprinkles into your web directory.

     Find out where your web server expects to find PHP files. For
     example, on some systems it would be /usr/local/www/html.

     Now make a directory for sprinkles and copy the installation
     there. Assuming you are in the Sprinkles download directory and
     your web directory is /usr/local/www/html execute the following
     commands:

       % cp -r . /usr/local/www/html/sprinkles

  5. Create a template cache directory.
  
     Create a directory called "templates_c" within the sprinkles
     installation directory. Make sure this directory is writable by the
     webserver.
     
       % cd /usr/local/www/html/sprinkles
       % mkdir templates_c
       % sudo chown www templates_c
     
  6. Create a MySQL database.

       % mysql
       mysql> create database sprinkles;
       mysql> ^D
       Bye
       % mysql sprinkles < sprinkles-schema.sql

     [TBD: add notes about configuring permissions for mysql users?]

  7. Configure the installation.

     Navigate a browser to <your-URL>/sprinkles. You should see a page
     that asks, "What is the address of your company's Satisfaction
     site?" Enter just the part of your company's URL that follows
     http://getsatisfaction.com/.

     Log in to Satisfaction using an existing Satisfaction account.
     Use an account that you will be use to administer the Sprinkles
     installation; this account does not need to be an admin of the
     company's existing Satisfaction presence. (If you don't have a
     Satisfaction account ... [TBD].)

     You will be asked whether you authorize the Sprinkles
     installation to act on your behalf; verify that you do.

     Next you should see the Sprinkles administration page, with a
     message such as "Your Sprinkles site is now hooked into..." with
     your URL.

     You can now configure several aspects of the Sprinkles
     installation, such as the site background color, header logo
     image, and contact details. You may also wish to name several
     more Satisfaction users as administrators. You can do this by
     entering their unique usernames in the field "Add additional
     admin." You should enter all the usernames that you want to be
     able to access the admin page--not just the new ones. (Note that
     a user's unique username can be found in the user's URL and are
     *not* always the same as the displayed name on the site.)

  8. Start using Sprinkles.

     You can use the navigation links in the header of the admin page
     to explore your Sprinkles site.

     Once you've saved the settings on the admin page, the URL
     <your-url>/sprinkles will take users to the "Help Start" page,
     which offers a list of topics about your company and other
     helpful information.
