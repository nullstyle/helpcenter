  - PHP v5 or later
  - Smarty
  - MySQL
  - hKit (Included.)
  - HTTP_Request

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  1. Install PHP.

     Instructions at http://www.php.net/docs.php

  2. Install MySQL.

     See http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html.

  3. Install PHP library dependencies.

     a) HTTP_Request

        The HTTP_Request library can be installed at the command line
        using pear:

          % pear install Http_Request

        Sprinkles has been tested with HTTP_Request version 1.4.2.

     b) Smarty
     
        Download the latest version of the Smarty templating engine from
        
          http://www.smarty.net/download.php
        
        Once downloaded, follow the directions in the INSTALL file in
        the package. You should just need to copy the files in the libs/
        directory into your PHP library location (for example, into
        /usr/local/lib/php/Smarty/)

  4. Install Sprinkles into your web directory.

	1. Install Sprinkles into your web directory.

       The next step is to install Sprinkles into a web-accessible
       directory. This can be installed either as a subdirectory or in
       the document root itself. The latter location would be preferable
       if you intend to have Sprinkles serve the main index of your
       domain or subdomain. If you are in the Sprinkles download archive
       directory, your web root is /var/www/html and you want to serve
       the Sprinkles application from http://example.com/help, you can
       execute the following command:
       
         % cp -R . /var/www/html/help

  5. Create a template cache directory.
  
     Create a directory called "templates_c" within the sprinkles
     installation directory. Make sure this directory is writable by the
     webserver.
     
       % cd /usr/local/www/html/sprinkles
       % mkdir templates_c
       % chown www templates_c
     
  6. Create a MySQL database.

       % mysql
       mysql> create database sprinkles;
       mysql> ^D
       Bye
       % mysql sprinkles < sprinkles-schema.sql

     [TBD: add notes about configuring permissions for mysql users?]

  7. Set database settings.
     
     Open the file config.php in the Sprinkles distribution and edit 
     the lines:
     
       $mysql_username = '';
       $mysql_password = '';
     
     Set the first two lines to your MySQL username and password, 
     respectively.
  
  8. Configure the installation.

     Navigate a browser to <your-URL>/sprinkles. You should see a page
     that asks, "What is the address of your company's Satisfaction
     site?" Enter just the part of your company's URL that follows
     http://getsatisfaction.com/.

     Log in to Satisfaction using an existing Satisfaction account.
     Use an account that you will be use to administer the Sprinkles
     installation; this account does not need to be an admin of the
     company's existing Satisfaction presence. (If you don't have a
     Satisfaction account ... [TBD].)

     You will be asked whether you authorize the Sprinkles
     installation to act on your behalf; verify that you do.

     Next you should see the Sprinkles administration page, with a
     message such as "Your Sprinkles site is now hooked into..." with
     your URL.

     You can now configure several aspects of the Sprinkles
     installation, such as the site background color, header logo
     image, and contact details. You may also wish to name several
     more Satisfaction users as administrators. You can do this by
     entering their unique usernames in the field "Add additional
     admin." You should enter all the usernames that you want to be
     able to access the admin page--not just the new ones. (Note that
     a user's unique username can be found in the user's URL and are
     *not* always the same as the displayed name on the site.)

  9. Start using Sprinkles.

     You can use the navigation links in the header of the admin page
     to explore your Sprinkles site.

     Once you've saved the settings on the admin page, the URL
     <your-url>/sprinkles will take users to the "Help Start" page,
     which offers a list of topics about your company and other
     helpful information.
