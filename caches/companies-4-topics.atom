    As I watch the feeds come in it would be good to know who created them. This information has an impact on how high priority it is (e.g. it's more important if the topic comes from outside the organization).

  <title>Admin How To: Managing Accounts and Roles</title>
  <updated>2007-11-20T22:14:42Z</updated>

  <content>
    The Accounts &amp; Roles page of the Admin section is where Admins can add employees, invite employees, assign roles and edit roles.<br /><br />
There are three levels of roles:<br /><br />
1. Employee = An Employee title is attached to their avatar in your Satisfaction site so that users know that they have an internal perspective. They do not have access to other tools or the Admin section. They can not mark a reply as the "Official Response" and their intereaction within the your Satisfaction site is not considered the official voice.<br /><br />
2. Official Rep = An Employee title is attached to your avatar in your Satisfaction site and your topic posts and replies within your own site are accompanied by an Official Rep badge which indicates that you are an official voice of the company. You can set your reply and other employee replies as the "Official Response". <br /><br />
3. Admin = Same controls and advantages of an Official Representative. You also will have access to the Admin tools via the Admin link in the top bar.<br /><br />
Adding employees:<br /><br />
- If you have an official email domain, add it under "Add a company website" and click the "Add it" button. Any employees already registered in Satisfaction with their official email address will automatically show up in the list above as an Employee. <br /><br />
- To add individual users add their email address under "Upgrade one person to employee status" and click  the "Upgrade" button. If they're already in the system with that email address they'll show up as an employee in the list above. If they're not, you'll be prompted to send them an invite to Satisfaction.<br /><br />
- Managing the roles: Once you have your list of employees under "Manage roles" you can change their role status or downgrade. Downgrading their employee affiliation will not delete their user account.

    When attempting to confirm my address for a one-time post, the system returned "Access Denied" when I used the supplied link in e-mail.  To get my post to "confirm" I had to upgrade my account, which did work.

    By replying to a topic you are automatically following it. However, if you'd like to follow a topic without replying to it just click the "Follow this topic" link under the topic post as illustrated here:<br /><br />
<a href="http://myskitch.com/amymuller/how_do_i_join_or_follow_something_on_satisfaction_-20070912-120855/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://myskitch.com/amymuller/how_do_i_join_or_follow_something_on_satisfaction_-20070912-120855.png/preview.jpg" alt="How do I join or follow something on Satisfaction?" /></a><br /><br /><br />
Following a topic means you'll receive email notifications when an update is made to the topic. If you've replied to a topic it will also appear in your dashboard.<br /><br />
If you want to "un-follow" a topic click the "stop" link next to "Following this topic" under the topic post. As illustrated here:<br /><br />

    Ma.gnolia has a Facebook application and company page that we'd love to be able to tie into Get Satisfaction. Are there plans for a Facebook application, and if not, may I suggest it. As if you don't already have enough work in a beta :)<br /><br />
We know how busy you must be, but hope you'll consider it. Cheers.

    The notification emails I get from you guys are helpful, but their formatting is quite different (and not nearly as aesthetically pleasing) as the rest of your website. <br /><br />
In particular, the relative sizing of the topic heading and the additional detail text are dramatically different. I'd also like to see a few more line breaks between items (e.g. the "Reply to this topic" and the "Follow this topic" text and links, as well as the topic name and topic link at the top).<br /><br />
The emails are hard to read in my email app on my computer, and on my Blackberry. Dialing down the text size differences and adding more line breaks would make things much more readable. <br /><br />
Kudos, however, for keeping them text-based and not using crazy HTML formatting.

    I just added the widget to my site MyHomie.com, and I think it's great, but I'd prefer that links to Satisfaction's site be loaded in a new browser window so my users don't lose their spot on my site.<br /><br />
Thanks!<br /><br />

    You can find our company "Ma.gnolia" using the company search, but not our only product with the same name using the product search.

  <title>In San Francisco? Join us for our appreciation party Thursday evening, November 15.</title>

    If you live in or around San Francisco, and you like to go out, we hope you’ll join us this Thursday night, November 15, for our Satisfaction appreciation party.<br /><br />
It’s our way of thanking everybody who’s helped us out over the past year (and if you’re reading this blog, you’re one of those people.) It’s been a great ride so far, and this is our way of saying thank you to everybody who supported us through it.<br /><br />
To make it extra super fun, we’re throwing the party with <a href="http://songbirdnest.com/" rel="nofollow">Songbird</a>, makers of the Songbird Media Player, because they’re the other San Francisco startup that likes to have fun. And since they’re a music company, they come with DJs; they’ve got a great line up planned.<br /><br />
And just for fun, we’re going with a Stanley Kubrick theme — “Kubrick &amp; Cupcakes,” to be exact. Aiming to recreate the milk bar sequence in “Clockwork Orange” as closely as possible (minus the excessive violence), so wear white and we’ll provide the bowler hats!<br /><br />
Details:<br />
Terra SF (<a href="http://urltea.com/236z" rel="nofollow">Map</a>)<br />
511 Harrison Street (@ First St.)<br />
7pm til late<br /><br />
Hope to see you there!

    We're working hard to make your dashboard more useful for keeping track of your activity, following the products and companies you love (or hate), and just making easier for you to get at the information you want. <br /><br />
We're rolling it out in a few phases. The first of which is available NOW! We call it "Phase 1." <br /><br />
So click on the <strong>Your Dashboard</strong> link above to check it out! Please let us know what you think.

  <title>Is there an RSS feed which includes entries for every topic and every reply for a company?</title>

    We are using Satisfaction for our company's customer service.  I have found the RSS feed for new topics but the only way of getting updated on new replies to topics is to visit getsatisfaction.com and explicitly follow the thread, which will subsequently email me.  This is somewhat tedious to say the least.<br /><br />
I would really like -- need even -- an RSS feed which contains all new topics and every reply for our company.  Is this possible?
