    The Accounts & Roles page of the Admin section is where Admins can add employees, invite employees, assign roles and edit roles.<br /><br />
There are three levels of roles:<br /><br />
1. Employee = An Employee title is attached to their avatar in your Satisfaction site so that users know that they have an internal perspective. They do not have access to other tools or the Admin section. They can not mark a reply as the "Official Response" and their intereaction within the your Satisfaction site is not considered the official voice.<br /><br />
2. Official Rep = An Employee title is attached to your avatar in your Satisfaction site and your topic posts and replies within your own site are accompanied by an Official Rep badge which indicates that you are an official voice of the company. You can set your reply and other employee replies as the "Official Response". <br /><br />
3. Admin = Same controls and advantages of an Official Representative. You also will have access to the Admin tools via the Admin link in the top bar.<br /><br />
Adding employees:<br /><br />
- If you have an official email domain, add it under "Add a company website" and click the "Add it" button. Any employees already registered in Satisfaction with their official email address will automatically show up in the list above as an Employee. <br /><br />
- To add individual users add their email address under "Upgrade one person to employee status" and click  the "Upgrade" button. If they're already in the system with that email address they'll show up as an employee in the list above. If they're not, you'll be prompted to send them an invite to Satisfaction.<br /><br />
- Managing the roles: Once you have your list of employees under "Manage roles" you can change their role status or downgrade. Downgrading their employee affiliation will not delete their user account.

    Thank you.

I was making changes to whose those folks are, so asking them to up my permissions wasn't an option.

    Hi Dean. I just did. 

FYI, you can also ask the person/people who is/are admin(s) to do this for you. And now that you're an admin you can change the status of the other roles.

    Hmm. Doesn't look like I am an Admin for my company. Can you please up my access to Me.dium? 

Thanks

    I think it must have been a caching issue for you. I just successfully upgraded her for you. However, if you see this again, please let us know.

Thanks for your bug reporting!

    I'm still seeing the same problem.  Our second employee is listed as employee status and there's a "downgrade" link showing up.  When I click the official representative radio button, nothing happens.  I navigate away to a new page and then back to the admin area and she is back at employee status -- the official rep selection isn't sticking.

    Hi Scott, a fix for updating employee status deployed with our launch last  night so this should be working now. Let me know if you have any further problems with it.

    It did hang again this second time around.  I was able to click a blank spot on the screen and that made the "posting" go away but the button changed back to "post reply."  So I clicked it a second time and this time the page refreshed right away and I saw my previous post on the site.

    Congrats on launching tomorrow -- and good luck!  I definitely know the chaos you guys must be experiencing right now.  But you guys have built a really cool site so it should all be worth it.  :-)

I did clear my cache and came back to this page -- sadly, the smiley faces are still covering up the input box.  They go away when I click on one of them, but it's still kind of a pain that they are in the way.  I'm about to click "post reply" so we'll see if it hangs again this time...

    Yeah, we identified, fixed and deployed the fix for this bug this morning. If you just saw this happen it could be a browser caching issue. Could you try refreshinig your browser and replying again? If it happens again please let us know.

    Hi scotth -- Yeah, we just discovered the bug ourselves with trying to change employee role status. We're working on it as I type.

I'll pass along the jumpy page elements. That could be a browser issue however, we've been debugging for browser compatibilty and IE 7 is definitely in our list of targetted browsers.

We're formally launching tomorrow so as you can imagine there is a LOT of work and deploying being done on the site today. Thanks for the de-bugging help!

    When I just tried to submit the response above, the "post reply" button turned into "posting" with an animation on it and it just stayed there forever.  I eventually closed my browser and came back to the site using Firefox, thinking I would have to re-submit my post (above).  But it looks like the site did in fact capture what I wrote, so I think you just need to figure out why the posting animation never went away.

I generally use IE 7.0 on Vista, btw, in case that's helpful in diagnosing the problem I described above.

    One of our employees just signed up and I see her listed as an employee on our admin page.  I'd like to make her an official rep, so I click that radio button but nothing happens.  I don't see a save or submit button, so I'm not sure how to execute the change.  There is a "downgrade" link showing up there but I want to upgrade her, not downgrade.  I even tried clicking "downgrade" but nothing happens.

Just now as I went to type this reply, the smiley face things suddenly moved up and obscured the entry box.  I had to click a smiley face in order to get that section to move back down the page.  I'm seeing lots of issues like this, with page elements overlapping one another, things jumping around a lot, etc.
