    Sorry we weren't able to get to all the topics today. We posted and will continue to post any updates to http://getsatisfaction.com/iwantsandy/topics/updates and have now called that topic out (albeit still a small link) in the company links section of the GetSatisfaction sidebar over there to the left.

    I agree, and staff members seem to be around; I don't 'get' why they don't answer the forum posts :-(
