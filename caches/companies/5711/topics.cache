    Michele was a great feature on the program.  Better than Pinhead and Patriots.

    Check out cbs7.com and read about a Texas border town named El Cenizo.  Please do a report on it for every LEGAL U.S. citizen to hear.  Or is this just a website to make more money for O'Reilly????? How can I get in touch with him?  This is very important!!!  I am more interested in the news than in buying something.  Please contact me.

    Perhaps, a positive thing that maybe could have happened in politics or, in health matters of concern.  I do and am shocked you are so, to be blunt unaware.  I feel you should be ashamed of yourself for this is not good!  Thanks if you see a good thing in your day.  I am starting to think bad of you.  Mary in Boca Raton Florida.  P.S. I still have the" No Spin Zone" door matt but it is spinning off the second floor and I don't care if you don't.  Get the picture?  Think and say something in the news that is positive and we will have less angry people.  It is distorted to feel that news is all negative.  I can think of plenty important good news that needs your recognition.  I am not reconizeing you much longer even if you know how to use big words. So there. I will not have your station in this house if you do not have something good to say about something once in a while.  We will not be listening to you much more because it is distorted and unproductive.

    There was a time when our Children were known as Children but now they are Kids. A Kid is a Goat and not a child. Our children have been devalued in recent years as abortion has been legalized. I do wish that Bill O'Reilly would be the one to return our Children back to their respected position in this world. They are not animals but humans. Those who wish to have them murdered while being borned are the ones who wish to put them on the level of animals.  Bill of chester, Va

  <title>Hello Mr. O'Reilly, I am concerned about the way money is being taken out of the Social Security fund and never put back</title>

    I have this question, is it legal for the government to take monies out of the Social Security fund without ever putting it back.  This is being done for over 10 years now, and the money, originally designated for the security of the elderly and paid in by them, has never been put back.  What say you, Mr. O'Reilly.<br />
