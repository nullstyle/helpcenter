    When I upload a logo in PNG or GIF form, it gets compressed way down as a JPEG.  This in turn makes everything look pretty ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Could you tweak that so it looks OK?  Or even better, leave the images as they are if they're already in PNG, GIF, or JPEG format?

    We're working hard to make your dashboard more useful for keeping track of your activity, following the products and companies you love (or hate), and just making easier for you to get at the information you want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're rolling it out in a few phases. The first of which is available NOW! We call it &quot;Phase 1.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So click on the &lt;strong&gt;Your Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; link above to check it out! Please let us know what you think.

    I like seeing all the new companies that get added. I see that you promote them, but I don't see a way to just get a feed of all the new companies as they get added. Any chance you can drop this into an RSS feed?

    When posting a reply in a particular company's Satisfaction site, please don't post the exact same reply to multiple topics. It just comes across as spam, and no one likes spam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you do post a verbatim reply to more than one place we may delete it in all but one location at our discretion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your cooperation! Let's try to keep Satisfaction useful and uncluttered.

  <title type="html">Thank You GetSatisfaction For Helping Us Build Relationships With The Companies I Like!!</title>

    Hey Satisfaction folks, it is early days by far, but I have just personally experienced the power of what you guys are doing, both on a personal basis, as well as the possibilities for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It used to be such that I will send an email to &quot;contact us&quot; to companies, and get an official email. Even if the rep sincerely wanted to help, it was a feeling of helplessness on either side. A feeling that I was alone, and a feeling on his side that he has little sway over the product/consumer policy process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But thanks to the power of 1) a public forum, 2) the &quot;human&quot; atmosphere provided by the tone/feeling of the site, allowing for both the employee and users to discuss stuff in a fun and human way, (even for complains), 3) the power of aggregating the voices of the consumers in one place, it must be empowering for both users as well as consumer advocates in the companies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, i have posted on 2 companies, getsatisfaction, and rescuetime, and i already feel that i have a relationship with both companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If blogs are the new mainstream, getsatisfaction (and the trend that you guys are going to start) will be the new generation of conversational marketing! :)

    I love your products and website. I saw a company that might help new customers understand what Satisfaction are all about. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eyeviewdigital.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.eyeviewdigital.com&lt;/a&gt; these guys prepare videos for online websites showing how to get things done on the website. Could really be helpful for new visitorsâ€¦ Hope this helps!

  <title type="html">Annoucing our first &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; Summit.</title>
  <updated>2007-11-23T16:40:47Z</updated>
  <author>
   <name>Lane Becker</name>

  <content type="html">
    Since Thor first presented on &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; at SXSW and then followed up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2007/03/19/why-customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/&quot;&gt;post about it&lt;/a&gt; on our blog, we've had a steady drumbeat of interest on the subject from people across a wide spectrum of industries, companies and job titles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, the topic has struck a nerve. We knew it was a subject we were obsessed with, but we had no idea so many people felt so passionately about what at a glance seems like it might make for pretty mundane subject matter. People from all sorts of industries have contacted us, wanting to share their stories about how to make customer service a better experience all around, or asking for tips and suggestions about how to get their own organizations to do customer service differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And, hey, we're a customer service organization, right? Give the customers what they want, and what our community  wants is a chance to learn, organize, and share around some of these emerging ideas. And so we're announcing our first &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; Summit, to be held in mid-November here in lovely San Francisco, California (exact date and location to be determined shortly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're currently hard at work putting together a full roster of speakers, pulling from a variety of industries (and not just the usual Web 2.0 crowd, though we'll have some of them, too), all of whom are finding ways to make customer service more meaningful for their organizations. We'll round out the day with some collaborative workshops, some probing interviews, some group discussion, plenty of food and of course the opportunity to mingle and network. More information on all this soon, we promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But first, of course, we want to hear from you: Would this be something you would be interested in? Who would you like to see speak? What kinds of other attendees would you want to meet? What topics would you find the most valuable? Let us know!

    Was trying to private message amy to ask her about her &quot;due date&quot;, but I did not notice a way for users to privately message each other - why not? I am sure that you folks have thought about the pros and cons many times before, but it might be very useful in terms of building up relationships between users. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So why have relationships between users? Cause I think the key power of conversational marketing from a company really comes through when a group of advocates are visibly visible. And ultimately, groups starts off one relationship at a time, with certain people being very active in contacting other members with similar interests, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That way, you can also identify who amongst your userbase are more likely to be the ones who are going to have the highest potential of forming these groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I believe this type of potential &quot;group builders&quot; is different from a user who types in many comments and questions. Those might just be power users with a lot of power/suggestions, but they might not be particularly social. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In a platform where people have the ability to privately message each other., you start see who are the potential &quot;group builders&quot;. At some stage, targeting these people will be fantastic for kickstarting various groups. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It becomes even more interesting when your facebook app encourages and facilitates me in terms of bringing my friends into the conversation... many ways of doing so, but the key thing here is bringing FB friends into the conversation in your site itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ok, I am going all over the place now from a single feature thought.... sorry sorry! End of the day, it is all about identifying &quot;group builders&quot;, and giving them the tools to build these groups of advocates! That is what conversational marketing can be ya? :)

    I want to type in the upper right search field and get a list of companies, products and users who match what I typed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The status quo is, type something in and receive results explicitly for the company the user is parked on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like as a first step towards the broader search, to be able just to search topics across the entire site. That would be imminently useful and increase my participation dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks, everyone! Satisfaction is a pleasure to use and I love the twitter widget.
