    usually in yahoo messenger an alert appears when a friend sends a message.&lt;br /&gt;
the problem i face is this. i am logged in. my friend is too. when i'm updating in twitter. she doesnt notice it immediately cos she is working. the twitter browser is probably minimised. if she is immersed in work she obviously forgets to check it. later in the day she realises it.&lt;br /&gt;
i think there's more joy in instantly being alerted about a message. it shouldnt happen in a roundabout way thru the mail.

    When I upload a logo in PNG or GIF form, it gets compressed way down as a JPEG.  This in turn makes everything look pretty ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Could you tweak that so it looks OK?  Or even better, leave the images as they are if they're already in PNG, GIF, or JPEG format?

    We're working hard to make your dashboard more useful for keeping track of your activity, following the products and companies you love (or hate), and just making easier for you to get at the information you want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're rolling it out in a few phases. The first of which is available NOW! We call it &quot;Phase 1.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So click on the &lt;strong&gt;Your Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; link above to check it out! Please let us know what you think.

    I like seeing all the new companies that get added. I see that you promote them, but I don't see a way to just get a feed of all the new companies as they get added. Any chance you can drop this into an RSS feed?

    When posting a reply in a particular company's Satisfaction site, please don't post the exact same reply to multiple topics. It just comes across as spam, and no one likes spam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you do post a verbatim reply to more than one place we may delete it in all but one location at our discretion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your cooperation! Let's try to keep Satisfaction useful and uncluttered.

    Hey Satisfaction folks, it is early days by far, but I have just personally experienced the power of what you guys are doing, both on a personal basis, as well as the possibilities for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It used to be such that I will send an email to &quot;contact us&quot; to companies, and get an official email. Even if the rep sincerely wanted to help, it was a feeling of helplessness on either side. A feeling that I was alone, and a feeling on his side that he has little sway over the product/consumer policy process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But thanks to the power of 1) a public forum, 2) the &quot;human&quot; atmosphere provided by the tone/feeling of the site, allowing for both the employee and users to discuss stuff in a fun and human way, (even for complains), 3) the power of aggregating the voices of the consumers in one place, it must be empowering for both users as well as consumer advocates in the companies.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, i have posted on 2 companies, getsatisfaction, and rescuetime, and i already feel that i have a relationship with both companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If blogs are the new mainstream, getsatisfaction (and the trend that you guys are going to start) will be the new generation of conversational marketing! :)

    I love your products and website. I saw a company that might help new customers understand what Satisfaction are all about. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eyeviewdigital.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.eyeviewdigital.com&lt;/a&gt; these guys prepare videos for online websites showing how to get things done on the website. Could really be helpful for new visitorsâ¦ Hope this helps!

  <title type="html">Annoucing our first &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; Summit.</title>
  <updated>2007-11-23T16:40:47Z</updated>
  <author>
   <name>Lane Becker</name>
   <uri>http://api.getsatisfaction.com/people/14</uri>
  </author>
  <content type="html">
    Since Thor first presented on &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; at SXSW and then followed up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2007/03/19/why-customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/&quot;&gt;post about it&lt;/a&gt; on our blog, we've had a steady drumbeat of interest on the subject from people across a wide spectrum of industries, companies and job titles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, the topic has struck a nerve. We knew it was a subject we were obsessed with, but we had no idea so many people felt so passionately about what at a glance seems like it might make for pretty mundane subject matter. People from all sorts of industries have contacted us, wanting to share their stories about how to make customer service a better experience all around, or asking for tips and suggestions about how to get their own organizations to do customer service differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And, hey, we're a customer service organization, right? Give the customers what they want, and what our community  wants is a chance to learn, organize, and share around some of these emerging ideas. And so we're announcing our first &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; Summit, to be held in mid-November here in lovely San Francisco, California (exact date and location to be determined shortly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're currently hard at work putting together a full roster of speakers, pulling from a variety of industries (and not just the usual Web 2.0 crowd, though we'll have some of them, too), all of whom are finding ways to make customer service more meaningful for their organizations. We'll round out the day with some collaborative workshops, some probing interviews, some group discussion, plenty of food and of course the opportunity to mingle and network. More information on all this soon, we promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But first, of course, we want to hear from you: Would this be something you would be interested in? Who would you like to see speak? What kinds of other attendees would you want to meet? What topics would you find the most valuable? Let us know!
