    We sell thousands of business and home office technology and offer and support many brands. We are not manufacturers and would like an option added to indicate product &quot;sold&quot; by rather than &quot;made&quot; by. As we add products we don't want to give the impression that we own a manufacturers brand. How can we be more clear about the products we represent?

    Howdy GS-ers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I've been finding myself battling with posting to GS from my iPhone due to sluggishness introduced by what I believe is the JavaScript working its magic on the reply posting textarea (the magic that resizes the textarea dynamically as you type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now I'm probably an anomaly in just how much I try to keep on top of GS replies from my iPhone combined with the typing speeds I've managed to achieve on the iPhone's faux-keyboard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But I am now routinely putting off replying until I return to my desktop -- which I'm near not as often as I have the time to reply these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(I wrote about a couple of causes of difficulty with the GS posting interface on the iPhone at &lt;a href=&quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/satisfaction/topics/floating_login_form_is_a_little_much_and_then_sometimes_not_obvious_at_all?subject=login+iphone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://getsatisfaction.com/satisfacti...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need to stop and wait to see what I've typed from one word to the next as the letters d   r    ib    bl   e   in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Any chance you could un-enhance the textarea when detecting an iPhone on the other end?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks, folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    Howdy,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have some amazing unofficial representatives in our &quot;I want Sandy&quot; Get Satisfaction community that I'd love to call out in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to testing, troubleshooting, and  generally providing terrific feedback, these unsung heroes also help others out along the way -- whether explicitly or by way of their detailed questions and thoughtful answers. And they often manage to do so before any of the official reps have even made it out of bed (or to bed, on some of our heavier days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As such, these folk deserve much appreciation, and I'd love a way to call them out as Unofficial Reps or Customer Reps or the like.  I could well imagine either a separate section for them between the Employees section and the list of others participating in the conversation.  Additionally, having them appear with a banner similar to what appears around us official folk would go a long way to making them more visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
By doing so, we'd both be recognizing their efforts and giving them the kudos they deserve and and dubbing them as official-ish enough that others don't feel they still need the official word. Overall, I think this would foster even more of the sort of customer-to-customer interaction you've done such a great job building an environment around already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At this point my options are limited; I can: a) mark them as Official Reps, but then they show up as employees and that's misleading, b) mark them as Official Reps but give them the title of &quot;Unofficial Rep&quot; or the like, but that still feels like a hack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Keep up the great work, folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last night we added our boutique (LuvCharlie) to Satisfaction, however, since then we have had a small issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Garland, our COO, created his original account, and you all activated him as the Administrator for the listing. Since then, Customer Service created an account (this account), and when he went to add them as an administrator, he saw that he was no longer an administrator himself. He then closed his account and put in a new request for Admnistrator status under Customer Service (this account).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We now have one main issue:&lt;br /&gt;
Garland's account is closed, yet he is still showing up as a member of the Company. His user thumbnail is also the thumbnail we need to use for Customer Service. It would be great if we could please have his account removed from the listing and ours added as an administrator so that we can simplify our branding and begin utilizing this Customer Service applet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry if this sounds confusing, please let us know if you all have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks a bunch in advance for your time!

    Since Thor first presented on &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; at SXSW and then followed up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.getsatisfaction.com/2007/03/19/why-customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/&quot;&gt;post about it&lt;/a&gt; on our blog, we've had a steady drumbeat of interest on the subject from people across a wide spectrum of industries, companies and job titles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, the topic has struck a nerve. We knew it was a subject we were obsessed with, but we had no idea so many people felt so passionately about what at a glance seems like it might make for pretty mundane subject matter. People from all sorts of industries have contacted us, wanting to share their stories about how to make customer service a better experience all around, or asking for tips and suggestions about how to get their own organizations to do customer service differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And, hey, we're a customer service organization, right? Give the customers what they want, and what our community  wants is a chance to learn, organize, and share around some of these emerging ideas. And so we're announcing our first &quot;Customer Service is the New Marketing&quot; Summit, to be held in mid-November here in lovely San Francisco, California (exact date and location to be determined shortly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We're currently hard at work putting together a full roster of speakers, pulling from a variety of industries (and not just the usual Web 2.0 crowd, though we'll have some of them, too), all of whom are finding ways to make customer service more meaningful for their organizations. We'll round out the day with some collaborative workshops, some probing interviews, some group discussion, plenty of food and of course the opportunity to mingle and network. More information on all this soon, we promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But first, of course, we want to hear from you: Would this be something you would be interested in? Who would you like to see speak? What kinds of other attendees would you want to meet? What topics would you find the most valuable? Let us know!

    Maybe this was already answered - I couldn't find it, let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to add a &quot;getsatisfaction.com&quot; section on my site; however - I don't like the idea of letting my customers see that they are completely outside my domain, for customer support.... it sounds to me similar to having &quot;gmail.com&quot; e-mail address used for business purposes :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm interested to know if there is the option to integrate smoothly &quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/my_company&quot; into &quot;www.my_company.com&quot;. Sure, I could hide the URL in many ways and make it look like they never actually left my domain. But I would like, if possible, the option to &quot;hide&quot; all the other companies/products, when I access an URL like &quot;http://getsatisfaction.com/my_company?just_my_company=true&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
(e.g. hide the header &amp; the &quot;find a: company&quot; search 'toolbar').&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have no problem if you still leave a &quot;powered by getsatisfaction.com&quot; logo in the page (which may be clickable, and may open getsatisfaction.com in a new window). It's not that I don't want you to get credit for providing the service - but I wouldn't want my customers &quot;confused&quot; when they click the 'customer service' link; they need to see just options relevant to my company - and NOT &quot;support issues&quot; for other companies, too.&lt;br /&gt;
Also, the 'regular' URL (with getsatisfaction.com/my_company) may work as it works now - i.e. without hiding anything. If someone reached the &quot;forum&quot; through getsatisfaction.com, there's no problem; but if he reached the forum through my site - I would like him to see only my company's issues, and not others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Actually - it would be great if through some mechanism (e.g. a 'session cookie'), when I redirect them to getsatisfaction.com/my_company, instead  of the regular 'header' I could use my &quot;custom header&quot; - e.g. place my logo there, and have a &quot;return to your account&quot; option. This way, I wouldn't have to hide the URL at all :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this possible/are you planning something like this?

    Attachments like screenshots can be useful for communicating clearly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is there any way to include images with Satisfaction topics?

    Pivotal Labs has two official reps right now. I was looking through some official answers by the other rep and starred a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I star his official response, I see it duplicated. There are two complete copies of the answer, both starred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If I back out and come back to the question, there is only one copy of the response, and it is properly starred.
